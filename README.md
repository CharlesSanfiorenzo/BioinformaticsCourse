# A Bioinformatics Crash Course.

Learn to program and carry out Bioinformatics-related work in **two** short lessons. This course will provide the background in Biology and Computer Science that is necessary in order to use and create tools capable of modeling, analyzing, and visualizing biological data. In each lesson, you will be using and creating a series of tools that are common to employees in the ever-growing fields of Pharmacy and Biotechnology. 

**At the end of the course, you will be assigned a community project aimed at the creation of a unique tool pertaining untackled biological problems. All participating members will be granted authorship of said tool, and any ensuing publications that make use of the community tools listed in this directory will cite tool authors as contributing parties.**
